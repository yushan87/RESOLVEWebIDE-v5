# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfigFile
# ~~~~~
# Play uses HOCON as its configuration file format.  HOCON has a number
# of advantages over other config formats, but there are two things that
# can be used when modifying settings.

## Modules
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Modules
# ~~~~~
# Control which modules are loaded when Play starts.  Note that modules are
# the replacement for "GlobalSettings", which are deprecated in 2.5.x.
# Please see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/GlobalSettings
# for more information.
#
# You can also extend Play functionality by using one of the publically available
# Play modules: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ModuleDirectory
play.modules {
  # By default, Play will load any class called Module that is defined
  # in the root package (the "app" directory), or you can define them
  # explicitly below.
  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  enabled += be.objectify.deadbolt.java.DeadboltModule
  enabled += modules.common.CustomDeadboltHook

  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #disabled += ""

## Internationalisation
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaI18N
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaI18N
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with its own i18n settings, which allow the user's preferred language
# to map through to internal messages, or allow the language to be stored in a cookie.
play.i18n {
  # The application languages
  langs = [ "en" ]

  # Whether the language cookie should be secure or not
  #langCookieSecure = true

  # Whether the HTTP only attribute of the cookie should be set to true
  #langCookieHttpOnly = true
}

## Play HTTP settings
# ~~~~~
play.http {
  ## Router
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaRouting
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaRouting
  # ~~~~~
  # Define the Router object to use for this application.
  # This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
  # so make sure this is the entry point.
  # Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
  # So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
  # you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
  # Default to Routes in the root package (aka "apps" folder) (and conf/routes)
  #router = my.application.Router

  ## Action Creator
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaActionCreator
  # ~~~~~
  #actionCreator = null
  
  ## Request Handler
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaActionCreator

  ## ErrorHandler
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaErrorHandling
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaErrorHandling
  # ~~~~~
  # If null, will attempt to load a class called ErrorHandler in the root package,
  #errorHandler = null

  ## Filters
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaHttpFilters
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaHttpFilters
  # ~~~~~
  # Filters run code on every request. They can be used to perform
  # common logic for all your actions, e.g. adding common headers.
  # Defaults to "Filters" in the root package (aka "apps" folder)
  # Alternatively you can explicitly register a class here.
  #filters = my.application.Filters
}

# Deadbolt 2 configurations
# More information can be found: https://deadbolt-java.readme.io/
